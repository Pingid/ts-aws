 * Provides permissions for the AWS Shield Advanced Shield response team (SRT) to access your account and your resource protections, to help you mitigate potential distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
 * **Configure `AWS::Shield::DRTAccess` for one account**
 * To configure this resource through AWS CloudFormation, you must be subscribed to AWS Shield Advanced. You can subscribe through the [Shield Advanced console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/) and through the APIs. For more information, see [Subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/enable-ddos-prem.html).
 * See example templates for Shield Advanced in AWS CloudFormation at [aws-samples/aws-shield-advanced-examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-shield-advanced-examples).
 * **Configure Shield Advanced using AWS CloudFormation and AWS Firewall Manager**
 * You might be able to use Firewall Manager with AWS CloudFormation to configure Shield Advanced across multiple accounts and protected resources. To do this, your accounts must be part of an organization in AWS Organizations. You can use Firewall Manager to configure Shield Advanced protections for any resource types except for Amazon RouteÂ 53 or AWS Global Accelerator.
 * For an example of this, see the one-click configuration guidance published by the AWS technical community at [One-click deployment of Shield Advanced](https://youtu.be/LCA3FwMk_QE).
