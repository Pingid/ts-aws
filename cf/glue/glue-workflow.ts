/**
 * You can use the Resource Tags property to apply tags to resources, which can help you identify and categorize those resources. You can tag only resources for which AWS CloudFormation supports tagging. For information about which resources you can tag with CloudFormation, see the individual resources in the [AWS resource and property types reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html).
 * ###### Note
 * 
 * Tagging implementations might vary by resource. For example, `AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup` provides an additional, required `PropagateAtLaunch` property as part of its tagging scheme.
 * In addition to any tags you define, CloudFormation automatically creates the following stack-level tags with the prefix `aws:`:
 * *   `` aws:cloudformation:`logical-id` ``
 *     
 * *   `` aws:cloudformation:`stack-id` ``
 *     
 * *   `` aws:cloudformation:`stack-name` ``
 * The `aws:` prefix is reserved for AWS use. This prefix is case-insensitive. If you use this prefix in the `Key` or `Value` property, you can't update or delete the tag. Tags with this prefix don't count toward the number of tags per resource.
 * Propagation of stack-level tags to resources, including automatically created tags, can vary by resource. For example, tags aren't propagated to Amazon EBS volumes that are created from block device mappings.
